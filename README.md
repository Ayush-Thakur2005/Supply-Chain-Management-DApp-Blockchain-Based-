**Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management DApp**

**Overview**

This Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management DApp is designed to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in supply chain operations. It leverages blockchain technology to ensure immutable record-keeping, traceability, and trust among all stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers.

**Features**

Decentralized & Secure: Uses blockchain to prevent fraud and unauthorized modifications.

End-to-End Traceability: Tracks goods from origin to destination in real time.

Smart Contracts: Automates transactions, reducing delays and middlemen.

Transparent Ledger: Ensures all stakeholders have a verifiable and tamper-proof record.

Role-Based Access Control: Restricts access based on user roles (e.g., Manufacturer, Supplier, Distributor, Retailer).

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a seamless experience for interacting with the blockchain.

**Technologies Used**

Blockchain Platform: Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric (Choose based on your implementation)

Smart Contracts: Solidity (for Ethereum) or Chaincode (for Hyperledger Fabric)

Frontend: React.js and TSX

Backend: Node.js 

Database: MongoDB (for additional metadata storage)

Wallet Integration: Ethers.js

Authentication: OAuth

**Installation & Setup**

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js & npm

Ganache (for local Ethereum testing)

Truffle / Hardhat (for smart contract deployment)

MetaMask (for interacting with the blockchain)

Docker (if using Hyperledger Fabric)

Steps to Run Locally

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Thakur2005/Supply-Chain-Management-DApp-Blockchain-Based-/

Install Dependencies:

npm install

Start Blockchain (Ethereum):

Run Ganache for a local blockchain.

Deploy smart contracts using Truffle or Hardhat:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

Run Backend Server:

npm run server

Start Frontend:

npm start

Connect MetaMask: Configure your wallet to use the local blockchain network.

Usage

Register & Login: Users can sign up and log in with their credentials.

Add Products: Manufacturers can add new products to the blockchain.

Track Shipments: Each transaction updates the product's location and status.

Verify Authenticity: Consumers can verify the authenticity and origin of products.

Smart Contract Structure

Product.sol: Defines product attributes and tracking.

SupplyChain.sol: Manages supply chain transactions and roles.

Future Enhancements

Implement AI-powered analytics for demand forecasting.

Integrate IoT sensors for real-time tracking.

Expand cross-chain interoperability.
